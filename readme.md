# A demo rust library

this is a demo rust library published on crates.io

you may have a look of source code in this repo how a minimal rust library could look like

to use this library

add `malik_sum = "0.1.4"` in your cargo.toml file in dependency section

and then in your code you may do something like this:

```
extern crate malik_sum;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    println!("add: {}", malik_sum::add(2, 6));
    println!("subtract: {}", malik_sum::subtract(2, 6));
    println!("multiply: {}", malik_sum::multiply(2, 6));
    println!("divide: {}", malik_sum::divide(2, 6));
    println!("power: {}", malik_sum::power(2, 6));
}
```
